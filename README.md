# Guide and Libraries

The environment used for this project is a conda environment with python 3.9.19. After the environment is created, the libraries used need to be installed using the commands listed. Also, since the outputs are long, the output is redirected to the stdoutfile, and its content can be viewed live through the terminal. The main.ipynb file is used as the entry point to execute all the functions of the project.
